# WhatsOnMcr
A Tech Test Created Using React Native - Expo

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Firstly, you will need to fork this repository, clone it to your machine and then open it up in your chosen code editor.

In your terminal:

```
git clone <link>

cd <name of folder>
```

## Prerequisites
In order to get started, you will need Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

If you are unsure about whether you have these installed, type the following command into your terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If both of these commands show a version number, then you have them installed, if not then go into your terminal and type:

```
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

Once you have it on your machine, to run the code and see the changes you have done, use:

```
npm install
```
This will install all dependencies needed for the product to run. Depending on your system, it can take a couple of minutes.

```
npm start
```

After a quick automatic expo-CLI install, this command will open up a browser window on your system, with a QR code present.
You will need to install an app called EXPO on your mobile device.
To see the project come to life, scan the ake sure your client is still running on your system!

## Thank you for looking! Have a great day!
